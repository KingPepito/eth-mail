# eth-mail
Repo used for the ENG-week! Goal was to get acknowledgement of receipt persisted in the blockchain after sending an email.

Please forgive the crappy code, this was meant to be a 3 days POC :)

You need to setup a local ganache ethereum blockchain then create and reference in the code the ContractFactory.

A react app is used for the front end (yarn start) and /backend/server.js is the one you want to run as backend.
